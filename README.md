## Problem Setting:
Online shopping is prevalent across all age groups. Understanding and predicting customer behavior during website sessions can help companies improve their strategies. We aim to build a model that predicts customer purchases based on features like session duration, region, and browser type.

## Problem Definition:
Developing a binary classification model to predict if a customer makes a purchase during a website session. Features include session duration, region, browser type, etc. The model's performance will be evaluated based on accuracy in predicting the "Revenue" column.

## Purpose:
This model assists the sales & marketing department in analyzing user behavior, allowing them to incentivize users with curated coupons or offers.

## Data Sources:
Dataset from UCI repository: [Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset#)

## Data Description:
- Over 12,330 sessions with 18 attributes.
- Features include page visits, duration, bounce rates, exit rates, page values, special day indicators, and more.
  
### Data Attributes:
1. Administrative: Number of administrative pages visited
2. Administrative Duration: Duration of administrative page visits
3. Informational: Number of informational pages visited
4. Informational Duration: Duration of informational page visits
5. Product Related: Number of product-related pages visited
6. ... (and more)

## Usage:
- Clone the repository
- Explore the dataset
- Run the provided models on different datasets
- Analyze ROC curves for Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting
- Make informed decisions based on model performance
